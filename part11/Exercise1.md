- Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

    - I assume that this is a small to medium-sized project due to the number of programmers and a cloud-based solution is probably the best due to easy setup and lower cost. But first I need to know the size of the project and the resources needed for the system to work optimally, so I can make the best decision.
